# Air-Pollution-and-Ashtma
The following project looks at the level of pollution in the state of new York between the years of 2008 and 2022 and see its impact on cases of asthma related hospitalizations and emergency visits. 
Here the levels of pollution can be measured on the baises of 3 main pollutants- 
1.	Nitrogen di-oxide: [(NO mean ppb)- mean nitrogen dioxide levels in parts per billion]
a.	Increases air-way inflammation 
b.	Reduces lung function 
c.	Weakens lung defense against infection making people with asthma more susceptible to fatal diseases. 
d.	Prolonged exposure may lead to permanent lung damage 
Nitrogen dioxide pollution can be caused by: 
a.	Vehicle emission 
b.	Industrial pollution 

2.	Fine Particulate matter: [(PM2.5 Mean mcg/m3 ) mean PM2.5 levels in microgram per cubic meter] 
a.	Irritates the air way 
b.	Causes Bronchoconstriction leading to asthma attacks 
c.	Prolonged exposure leads to reduced lung functions 
Fine particulate matter is caused by: 
a.	Vehicle exhaust
b.	Industrial pollution 
c.	Wildfires
d.	Construction dust

3.	Black Carbon: [(Black Carbon Mean Absorbance) mean black carbon levels]
a.	Chronic inflammation 
b.	Acts as an irritant making airways more sensitive to other asthma triggers as well. 
c.	cause bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways), leading to difficulty in breathing and severe asthma attacks.
d.	Increases the severity of Asthma 
Black Carbon pollution is caused by:
a.	Vehicle emission 
b.	Industrial pollution 
c.	Biomass burning 
d.	Incomplete combustion of fossil fuel.
